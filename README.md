# Swashbuckle ASP.NET API Versioning Example

A version of [SwashbuckleAspNetApiVersioningExample](https://github.com/rh072005/SwashbuckleAspNetApiVersioningExample) that got lost along the way

Example Web API (ASP.NET Core on full .NET Framework) that uses [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle) and [ASP NET Web API Versioning](https://github.com/Microsoft/aspnet-api-versioning)

This is an attempt at fixing [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore issue 244](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/issues/244)

In addition the to the above, API versions are now also added via reflection - any better implementations of this would be welcomed.
